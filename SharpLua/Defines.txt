This file describes some the DEFINEs that you can edit.

OVERRIDE_LOAD
    This is unnecessary, as it is ignored. 
    It should define whether #Lua overrides the default parser to allow its syntax 
    extensions to be used.

IMPLICIT_VARARG
    This defines whether all functions are implicitly vararg or not. 
    This is somewhat javascript-style, as js has implicit varargs.
    It is enabled by default. If LUA_COMPAT_VARARG is also enabled, it defines the 'arg' variable

LUA_COMPAT_VARARG
    Whether vararg functions have an implicit 'arg' variable

VANILLA_LUA
    Whether the parser in the NewParser folder should have the extended #Lua syntax or 
    just plain Lua syntax. It should not be defined, but if you wish to re-use a lua parser
    somewhere else, it can be defined.
